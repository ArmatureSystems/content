
The process of offboarding employees is a tiresome, time-consuming, long process. It requires that actions be taken in multiple departments of the organization - HR, IT, logistics and so on.
Typically, because of the magnitude of this process, the right actions are not always taken, and the process either takes very long to complete, or never completes fully - leaving the company vulnerable to data leaks, unauthorized access and other risks associated with an incomplete offboarding process.
Using Cortex XSOAR, you can streamline this process, keep better track of your checklist and automate anything that doesn't require physical human interaction.


##### What does this pack do?
- Schedules a time for the offboarding process to begin
- Gathers employee and manager information from various sources - Active Directory, Okta, Duo, Google and Service Now
- Delegates permissions and access from offboarded employee to manager
- Revokes roles, security and access permissions for the offboarded employee and resets passwords
- Retains important employee information for legal purposes, for a configurable period of time
- Removes employee information from all systems or applies special policies for offboarded employees

As part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box incident fields, layouts and playbooks for employee offboarding. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.
The pack features an additional, fully manual playbook for organizations that prefer to keep the process manual.
